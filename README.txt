AMAZING BALLS- the README file

#@#@#@#@#@#@#@#@#@#@#@#@#@#@#@#@#@#@#@#@#@#

Amazing Balls is an incredibly immersive 
3D experience, WOAH!  Roll your way through
three, count em, three levels!  Designed by
a crack team of young game devs, Amazing
Balls is going to knock your socks into 
orbit!  

What's better than a wood ball labyrinth?
A WOOD BALL LABYRINTH SET IN SPACE!  WITH
LAVA!  Use the arrow keys or w,a,s,d keys 
to navigate around the lava in each level 
and make it to the blue goal!  IF and only 
IF you survive the first two levels, will 
you battle with THE WIDOW MAKER!  Dan's
magnum opus of oppression, it's like nothing
you've ever seen, it's nothing you've ever
wanted to see!  The camera even rotates when 
you reach a checkpoint!  The third level of 
this game destroyed my life and now I'm a 
computer science major.  

Rules of Amazing Balls:
-navigate to the blue goal
-avoid the lava
-try not to cry
